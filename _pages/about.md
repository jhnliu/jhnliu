<!-- > Life is like a box of chocolates.<cite>Forrest Gump (1994)</cite> -->

This is a collection of projects I have worked on and ideas that I will explore. Quoted from Forrest Gump, "Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you gonna get." I love exploring new things with curiosity and an open mind. We have two boxes of chocolates here. One is about my genuine interest in machine learning and data. Another is about my life.
