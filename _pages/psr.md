title: "Paper Scissors Rock with Computer Vision and Pygame"
---

## Introduction
Life in Sydney lockdown was not easy. I had too much time alone and I wanna create a virtual player to play some simple games with me. Games that are simple, yet intriguing enough to keep you playing. How about paper scissors rock?

With computer vision and hand gesture recognition, I built a face2face version of the classic game. The goal is to increase my interation with my oponent. As compared to traditional mobile version where players choose their moves by clicking buttons, now I play as if I am playing with my friend.
